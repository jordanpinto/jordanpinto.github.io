        <p> Hi World,<br>I'm so excited to start this blog to let everyone know about my journey and how it started. Growing up, I didn't really care about how computers worked or the "code behind the curtain". In fact, I didn't even think about learning to code until I was about 28. I had an epiphany one day that learning to code was going to be a very important skillset - especially when I searched for jobs and read about the increasely significant call for automation.</p>
        
        <p>So I signed up at FreeCodeCamo and started to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript because I really wanted to learn front-end web development and possibly do freelance web design!</p>
        
        <p> Thanks for reading - see you next time!</p>
        <br>

        <p>Aloha again,<br> It's been a while... I'll admit it was tough to code every day and I got distracted trying to learn Spanish as well. I'm trying too many things at once and need to <i><b>FOCUS</b></i>.</p>
        <p>Time to try again. This is what I'm going to do:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Do at least one lecture/challenge on Khan Academy every day.</li>
            <li>Work with friends to keep pushing ourselves to get better.</li>
            <li>Find a programming podcast to listen to (any suggestions are welcome!).</li>
            <li>Profit.</li>
        </ol>
        
        
    </body>
